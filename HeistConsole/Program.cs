//make some notes for a potential plan of action

/* -make a team member and print it
 *   -make a TeamMember class, including a ToString()
 * -gonna need to validate the inputs are correct (string, int, decimal)
 *   -validation methods located in TeamMember class?  No, before the creation of the object, so during input.
 * -maybe a TeamMemberFactory class to handle all inquiries and validation?
